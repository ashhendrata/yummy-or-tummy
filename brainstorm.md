# Step 1: Generate new ideas
1. Allergy detection app: Scans through ingredient list of a food product OR menu and highlights allergies as inputted by the user
2. Movie tinder: Helps curate a list of future watches
3. Parking spot finder: Finds nearby parking spots
4. Bathroom finder: Locates the nearest free bathroom
5. Gamified step counter app: Earn points with your steps
6. Gamified habit tracker: Earn points if you stick with a habit for x number of days

# Step 2: Evaluating App Ideas
## Allergy detection app
### Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
- Utilizes the back camera
- Allows for easy storage and checking when shopping
- Personalized for the user due to allergies
- Can track location and identify what foods you are allergic to
### Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
- Helps people feel safe eating out
- Don't have to worry about medical emergencies in public
- Streamlines shopping and ordering process
### Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
- 20 million people have food allergies in the U.S.
- Allergies can mean a tummy ache or death
### Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
- Everytime someone goes to eat out or goes shopping (realistically a few times a week for the app to be used)
- Create allergy lists or warning lists
### Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
- I think it is doable to aim for 100% completion
- A stripped-down version with just the scanning and yes/no detection is still cool

## Gamified habit tracker
### Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
- Accessible to use at any time easily
- Personlized
- Step tracking can be synced
- Maps can be used to track runs and other distance-related habits
### Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
- Everyone wants to build habits
- By using in-app currency to encourage building habits, motivation will be amplified
- Value will be in the UI especially
### Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
- Anyone who wants to start a new chapter especially might be drawn to this
- Because distance tracking is in-built, might be more appealing to cyclists/runners/walkers/etc.
### Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
- Encouraged to check in everyday to build streaks
- Create lists of habits to track, each habit has its own "bank"
### Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
- Hard to complete in 3 weeks, especially with emphasis on UI beyond storyboard components
- May be worth trying the step counter

Final decision: Allergy detection app called yum or tum
