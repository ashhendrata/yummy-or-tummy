## Overview

### Description

Detects allergies from menus and ingredient lists at the back of packaged product. Steamlines ordering at restaurants and grocery shopping.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Health
- **Mobile:** Back camera, location tracking, personalization
- **Story:** Helps people feel safe eating out, decrease risk of medical emergencies, streamlines shopping and ordering process.
- **Market:** 20 million people have food allergies in the U.S., allergies can cause tummy aches to death
- **Habit:** Everytime someone goes to eat out or goes shopping (realistically a few times a week for the app to be used), Create allergy lists or warning lists
- **Scope:** I think it is doable to aim for 100% completion, A stripped-down version with just the scanning and yes/no detection is still cool

Challenges faced: starting was the hardest! And learning how to use the back camera was a journey

What's next: Detecting text in the photos taken

Update: has not been incorporated with camera BUT i implemented the text reading feature tested with images
